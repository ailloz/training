	- [ ] A great introduction to python [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8pPdKYpowI&ab_channel=TechWorldwithNana). It is equivalent to a course. But very useful if you are new to python. 
	- [ ] An [introduction to OOP in python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeznW_7DlB0&ab_channel=TechWithTim). 
	- [ ] [Asyc programming in python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Bo1Je9EmE&ab_channel=TechWithTim)
- [ ] Basics
	- [ ] Syntax, PEP8
	- [ ] OOP/functional programming in Python
	- [ ] Multithreading, multiprocessing, asynchronous programming. 
	- [ ] Global Interpreter Lock (just know what it is).
	- [ ] Modern python language features 3.6+ (f-strings/match, walrus operator, decorators, etc)
