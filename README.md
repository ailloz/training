# Using this repository
- The most efficient way of using this repo, is by using Obsidian markdown tool, because some of the notes here are using the Kanban community plugin of Obsidian. But if you wish not to use the Kanban feature, you can use any markdown app to access these files and use them as checklists, etc.
- Most directories have an agenda.md file which is using the Obsidian Kanban plugin for you to track your progress, and other files with either information or checklists.
