- TestRail is a test case management software; Itâ€™s what we use to store our nightly test results and also run our manual tests.
- Automated results are reported nightly through TestRail API and are added under each nightly tag, per environment name.
- Nightly report links are also posted in #testrail_nightly_report channel every morning.
