### Automation Labs

Refer to [wiki](https://guardicore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TESTING/pages/3642228778/Automation+Labs). 

Watch all recordings and/or schedule sessions.

  

There are over a dozen labs. They are ordered in the chart by simplicity. You do not have to watch all of the videos / have all of the sessions during your onboarding period. Keep this list as a reference, and try to complete it within your first two months in the team. 

  

We run our labs locally using WSL. Refer to the guide to [https://guardicore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TESTING/pages/3677749308/How+to+setup+AOL+ORCH+OSLAB+PEL+with+wsl2.+Alternative](https://guardicore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TESTING/pages/3677749308/How+to+setup+AOL+ORCH+OSLAB+PEL+with+wsl2.+Alternative) 

  
  

# Running Tests

This is where the value of the automation team really comes in.

  

So far, you see that there are a lot of tests, over a dozen or more different testing suites, each one tailored for a different testing purpose and component. 

  

In this section, we will go over how our tests are actually run, how often they run, and how and where they are run. This part can get a bit Dev-Opsi :) 

### Nightly Testing Environments (“Autotesters”)

1.  Every evening (~18:00) we’re running our tests on 3 different versions of Centra: 
    

1.  The stable version (“master-2”) - runs once a week
    
2.  The current version (“master-1”) - runs once a week
    
3.  The development version (“master”) - runs 5 times a week. 
    

3.  Each version (“build”) can be run on different environment configurations, so we’re testing several configurations as well.
    
4.  In the morning we go over the results to see what's the status of every build.
    
5.  Nightly reports are re ported to TestRail.
    

  
  

### TestRail

1.  TestRail is a test case management software; It’s what we use to store our nightly test results and also run our manual tests.
    
2.  Automated results are reported nightly through TestRail API and are added under each nightly tag, per environment name.
    
3.  Nightly report links are also posted in #testrail_nightly_report channel every morning.
    

  

## Logs and Debugging

Guardicore Logs:

1.  Every Centra component creates log files that can be very helpful during debugging. See these main logs and where they are located:
    

  

2.  Agent (Linux + Windows)
    

-   gc-guest-agent.log: Reveal agent.
    
-   gc-enforcement-agent.log/ deception server):
    

-   guardicore.hp_vm.log : Shows all information about the HPVM.
    
-   To verify HPVM is up, search for GGGGG (a big GO sign).
    
-   Logs location: /var/log/guardicore
    

  

Playground:

Through the tester playground you can access the Centra API directly. management_client has access to client.py methods.

-   Running playground can be done from : Enforcement.
    
-   gc-deception-agent.log: Redirection to honeypot (HPVM).
    
-   gc-detection-agent.log: FIM and OSQuery (Insight).
    

Logs location:

-   Linux: /var/log/
    
-   Windows: C:\ProgramData\Guardicore\logs (windows 2008+).
    
-   Windows 2000/2003: C:\Program Files\Guardicore\logs
    

3.  Aggregator:
    

-   Many logs, all logs are prefixed with aggregator (but also mitigation).
    
-   Best strategy is to grep (or zgrep)
    
-   mitigation.worker.* responsible to send the aggregated data to the mgmt.
    
-   Logs location: /var/log/guardicore
    
-     
    

4.  Mgmt:
    

-   gc-cluster-cli health: Services health on the mgmt.
    
-   Most important log: rest-server.*.log
    
-   Errors in Centra's bell icon will be shown in the corresponding service / rest-service log.
    
-   Best strategy is to grep (or zgrep)
    
-   Logs location: /var/log/guardicore
    

5.  HPVM (Honeypot virtual machine  pycharm after you have cloned the guardicore repository. Instructions and code are in `tests/qa/tools/playground/playground.py`
    

  
  

## Automation Hands-On

1.  write your first tests on AOL. For reference see test_monitoring_enforcement_sanity
    

-   policy related test:
    

1.  choose two machines
    
2.  create an allow rule between them (over a random port)
    
3.  perform a connection - make sure it was allowed
    
4.  create and override-block rule between them over the same port
    
5.  perform a connection - make sure it was blocked
    
6.  perform a connection on a different port - make sure it was allowed.
    

3.  Write test using traffic generator:
    

-   Preparation: create two Linux hosts in the same network (HostA and HostB).
    
-   Use traffic generator deploy API to deploy traffic generator on both hosts.
    
-   Test UDP connectivity from HostA to HostB.
    
-   Test ICMP connectivity from HostB to HostA.
    

5.  Get know PEL
    

-   Take a look on PEL [design](https://guardicore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TESTING/pages/1741291766/PEL+-+Policy+enforcement+lab)
    
-   Take a look on README (tests/pel/README.md)
    
-   Create PEL env by running  ‘prepare` step from [Jenkins](https://jenkins.guardi/job/Policy_Enforcement_Lab_v2/) 
    

1.  See your env on [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=guardicore-26097118&instancessize=50)
    

-   Run tests on existing env with Jenkins Job.
    
-   Execute tests locally (see README)
    

1.  To be able to do that, allow ssh from your public IP. Add rule [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/list?project=guardicore-26097118). 
    

-   Add a new test: block a specific port and make sure it is blocked, make sure the agent blocks only that port.
    
-   Destroy your environment by executing “main.py” locally.
    

  

  

## Guardicore Centra Basics - Hands On (manual)

1.  Introduction to the testing env -  [span diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1RimBfAGAhx78Y6DizJqY0LcTSfxH8aqJtGLRtmNrPc0) and [thin diagram](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vLeWZbiYzh4NlC1Lm8sa8B1rzNpz60_cn-pZK4RHbwA)
    
2.  Getting to know Centra
    

*** In the following sections you’ll get some hands on experience working with Centra. While you’re getting to know your squeaky clean test env make sure that it was built with the previous version (and not from the master branch) ***

At any time - DON'T hesitate to ask Questions :)

  

### User Manuals

Read and follow the User Manual (it will help you with the following steps).  
The manual can be viewed at our customer portal:  
[https://customers.Guardicore.com/](https://customers.guardicore.com/)

  

### Labeling

-   Create a new label (Centra->Reveal->Labels) named Agent:EvenNumber with criteria of names that either end with 2 or end with 4. Do the same for Agent:OddNumber and 1 or 3.
    
-   Add label groups which will include these two labels 
    
-   Try deleting the OddNumber label 
    
-   Create a new dynamic label with criteria of full ip (100.100.102.211)
    
-   Add the ip to one of the agents and verify the agent appears in the new dynamic label 
    

### Reveal

This feature is what helps us to see traffic in the data-center.  
In order to “feel” the feature, we will create some traffic and play with it in order to see how it works.  
The traffic can then be ‘visualized’ in a map.  
These are the things we will be doing:

-   Generate internal/external traffic in the datacenter
    
-   Install Interesting application to you choice (that perform network traffic) and examine how it looks in the Datacenter view
    
-   Define a simple segmentation policy and create an incident
    
-   Check out the UI:
    

-   Reveal -> Data Center
    
-   Network Log
    

The how to:

1.  Make a number of  connections to ports 5555, 6666, 7777, 8888 between the attackers/servers using netcat. For example:
    

1.  on Server1: nc -l -p 8888
    
2.  On Attacker1: nc 172.17.0.2 8888
    

3.  Make some connections to the internet (for example wget [www.ynet.co.il](http://www.yent.co.il), wget [www.evil.xyz.com](http://www.evil.msn.com))
    

  

 Now login to the UI and check out the reveal map (Reveal -> Saved Maps):

1.  Create a new saved map with connections from the past 5 hours
    
2.  Open the saved map. can you make sense of what’s going on there? Retrace your steps and see how they look on the map (Double click the nodes to get all the way down to the process level)
    
3.  Filter out only connections to the internet
    
4.  Filter out connections from Attacker1
    
5.  Filter out connections from IP 100.100.100.11
    
6.  Filter out connections from one of the labels you've created earlier
    
7.  Exclude connections on  port 8888
    
8.  Change the grouping option to hosts. 
    
9.  Verify all of the connections appears in the network log 
    
10.  Follow the logs flow for one of the reported connections (Agent to Mgmt)
    

  

### Deception

Deception is a feature that redirects suspicious traffic to a “honeypot” VM in order make the attackers think they are actually attacking a real server in the data-center, while allowing Guardicore to collect data about the attackers and their attack vector.  
  
In order for you to simulate a simple “attack” and experience this we to generate some connections that would create incidents as well

-   Create incidents:
    

-   Perform a “lateral movement” attack and a network scan
    

-   Linux Services: SSH FTP MySQL
    
-   Windows Services: SMB RDP
    

-   Perform Failed connection to existing host (TCP redirection)
    

(drop the traffic by iptables, so the host won’t answer it) 

-   Perform Failed connection to non existing host (ARP redirection)
    

(this might take several attempts to different ips. Ask why!)

-   Add a bypass inspection rule and do another attack
    

-   Check out the UI:
    

-   Centra->Activity->Redirections Log
    
-   Centra->Incidents
    
-   Security Dashboard
    

  
You may follow these instructions to create such incidents and experience it for yourself:

Incident #1:

-   From Attacker1 connect to 100.100.100.187  (try to guess the passwords)
    
-   Check out the server you’ve reached – what’s its name? run some basic commands (ifconfig, netstat)… Get creative :) 
    

  

Incident #2:

-   From Attacker1 connect to 100.100.100.197
    
-   Add a user, add it to the sudo group and test it.
    

-   adduser <username>
    
-   su - <username>
    
-   sudo ls -la /root
    

  Incident #3:

-   Connect to  Attacker2
    
-   Download Nmap
    

-   apt-get install nmap
    

-   Run a scan: 
    

-   nmap -sV 100.100.100.100-105
    

  

Now it’s time to connect to the UI:

Go to https://<your_env_number>.thin.env:8000

1.  Explore the redirection log (Centra->Activity->Redirections Log)
    

1.  Filter out IP 100.100.100.87. How many DPs reported network activity? What’s the difference between the reports?
    
2.  Filter out activity from Attacker2. What do you see?
    

3.  Explore the incidents screen (Centra->Incidents->All Incidents)
    

1.  Do you recognize the attacks you made? What happened as a result of the scan? 
    
2.  Filter out the incidents that were tagged as “Human”
    
3.  Clear previous filters and filter out High severity incidents, dive into them:
    

1.  see the detailed play by play vs the summary
    
2.  check out the different tabs
    

5.  Follow the logs flow (Agent to Mgmt)
    

  

### Reputation: 

-   configure Q-server to “q.guardi” and perform connections to “[http://www.evil.msn.com](http://www.evil.msn.com)”
    
-   try a few more connections and see what reputation-incidents are created
    

### Policy: 

The Policy pages are where a customer configures all the rules for his data-center.  
In general, rules can either be “allow”, “alert”, “block”.  
There are several more rule types that are based on those 3 rules, feel free to explore them yourself in the application.  
  
In order for you to get a feeling of this feature, you can practice the following:

-   Create a new alert rule in segmentation screen (Centra->Policy->Segmentation Rules) with source label Agent:OddNumber, destination label Agent:EvenNumber and destination port 6666 TCP. Publish the rule.
    
-   Create a new block rule from any to internet on port 12345 TCP
    
-   Publish the rules and verify :
    

-   Agent received the relevant policies 
    
-   Follow the logs flow (Mgmt to Agent)
    

-   Make  a connection (with nc) between OddNumber and EventNumber machines which are in the labels.
    
-   Make a connection between any machine to the internet on port 12345 tcp 
    
-   Make a connection between any machine to the internet on port 12345 udp
    
-   Verify all of the connections appears in the network log 
    
-   Create a new map and verify all connections appears in it .
    
-   Revert the last revision before adding the rule in stage A.
    
-   Verify that the relevant agents received the relevant policies.
    

### Orchestration Data: 

-   Check out Centra-> Assets
    
-   look at Orchestration page in a nested and non-nested env. what’s the difference?
    

### File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

-   ([Omri Ossie](mailto:omri.ossie@guardicore.com) is our FIM master - feel free to ask for help) 
    
-   Define FIM template 
    
-   Verify it looks legit 
    
-   Change the protected file content. See what happens
    

### Component Monitoring:

-    Perform basic component maintenance checks for the management/aggregators/deception server and agents:
    

-   Learn about [monicore](https://guardicore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MGMT/pages/33980455/Monicore+v2)
    
-   Reboot the components 
    
-   Check their status
    
-   Start/stop services
    

-   Check out the UI:
    

-   admin->Detection/Collectors/Aggregators/Agents
    
-   system log (alarm bell on the top right)
    

-   Explore the assets screen (Centra-> Assets):
    

-   Which assets are at risk?
    
-   Dive into Attacker1 and Attacker2, check out the different tabs and verify the relevant label appears in the asset page.
    

  

### RBAC (Role Based Access)

RBAC allows for multiple users with different roles and permissions.  
You can play around with it and see it in action.

-   Choose one role (or more) from here : [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awauWJQAwRr-z3jmdq0F4OgFJYNP-KvhDl1Gf-KIcBU/edit#gid=0)
    
-   Verify the Permissions for this role in the ui
    

  

### Explore Centra

Now that you have played around with Centra, created some connection flows, looked at some maps and created some rules, it’s time to play around more and do some ‘free exploration’.  
Search for pages / features / buttons that you are not familiar with and feel free to ask questions about them. 

  

### Look at a real live Centra in action

## Agent Operations Lab - Hands On

After you have your Agent Operations Lab talk, the best way to understand how things work is to practice writing some new tests. 

  

Look here for options for running the tests -  
[Agent Operations Lab Wiki](https://guardicore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TESTING/pages/1912932089/Agent+Operations+Lab)

  
  

Let’s start by creating a new tests module. Add a python script file under  
guardicore\tests\agents\agent_operations_lab_scenarios  
named test_training_aol.py (or any other name starting with test_).

  

Add this at the top of your file -

import pytest

import logging

  

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

pytestmark = pytest.mark.training

  

The last line will mark all the tests as training - so you can target them later.

You’ll also need to add a matching configuration in -  
guardicore\tests\agents\agent_operations_lab\agent_operations_lab\plugin.py

  

Under pytest_configure, add another configuration 

config.addinivalue_line("markers", "training: "

                                        "mark to group Training tests.")

  
  

Let’s add the first test -

  

@pytest.mark.run(order=1)

@pytest.mark.possible_tested_os(os=[AllocationOS.UBUNTU_16])

def test_install_agent_default_profile(test_machine: ClonedMachine):

    log.info(f"Testing machine {test_machine}")

  
  

This is the minimal setup you’ll need. Now you can use Management Utils, Traffic Generator, or any other  fixture to make actions.

  
  
  

Take a look at 

guardicore\tests\agents\agent_operations_lab_scenarios\examples

To see usage examples.

  
  

Try to add the following scenarios (and make them dependent) -

1.  Install an Agent, and get the Agent’s version
    
2.  Add an installation profile, and add a policy rule (for a random port)
    
3.  Use a supporting machine to create traffic, and then validate it appears in the Network Log on Management
    
4.  Uninstall the Agent, and make sure Agent Missing flag appeared on the Management
    

  

When you’re done, run the tests on Jenkins and look at the output (HTML, log, JUnit).
