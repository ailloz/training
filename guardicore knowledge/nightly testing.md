- Every evening (~18:00) we’re running our tests on 3 different versions of Centra: 
	1.  The stable version (“master-2”) - runs once a week
	2.  The current version (“master-1”) - runs once a week
	3.  The development version (“master”) - runs 5 times a week. 
- Each version (“build”) can be run on different environment configurations, so we’re testing several configurations as well.
- In the morning we go over the results to see what's the status of every build.
- Nightly reports are re ported to TestRail.
